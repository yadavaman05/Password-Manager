You can choose between two officially supported React plugins:

@vitejs/plugin-react

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc

Uses SWC for faster builds and improved performance.

🧠 React Compiler

The React Compiler is disabled by default due to its impact on development and build performance.
If you need it, you can enable it by following the official guide:
